Today I completed the TryHackMe module titled "Starting out in Cyber Sec". Good introductionary article for our class. It introduced me to the two typical paths one can take in a cyber security career; Offensive and Defensive teams, or red and blue teams, are how we simulate penetration tests to test security. 

Inside each introduction to offensive and defensive security there are multiple links to different "hacktivities" available on TryHackMe as well as links to further information, like an introduction to Splunk, a tool to create logs on information about a system and its events.

I spent a good amount of time digging around the Splunk article, answering the quiz about different terms on the quick reference sheet for the program. Most of the other links led to the beginner course for TryHackMe's main features.
