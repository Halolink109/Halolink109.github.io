title: WebOSINT - Web Detective
---
This activity on TryHackMe is like playing virtual detective trying to find out as much information as you can about old outdated websites that no longger exist, in the typical sense. Websites like Archive.org and who.is can give us a great amount of information on old websites that you can't visit anymore. With the combination of these two websites and others I was able to locate the information needed to complete the activity. It wasn't entirely easy though, most of the information provided to you by these websites are lacking, and not always correct, and who.is doesn't give you information about the websites past. There was a fair amount of googling involved in this assignment.
