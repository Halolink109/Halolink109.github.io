title: Encryption - Crypto 101 - Locks and Keys
---
The TryHackMe Room "Encryption - Crypto 101" focuses on the kind of security we encounter when accessing HTTPS or HTTP websites. When connecting to websites we send a request through the internet, if it werent for the HTTP Tunnel, all our information would be available for others to read and write to. Encryption is the name of the game, encryption protects our sensitive information like passwords as we log into a website. There are different methods and keys used for encryption as the room tells us, some use larger keys, or use pairs of keys to keep our data protected.

Nowadays HTTPS is more commonly used as it has two layers of protection, with the typical HTTP encryption with an added layer of SSL encryption. At the end of the room there is info on quantam computing, and how our previous methods of encryption are likely to be broken and useless by the computing power of the future. For now, HTTPS is very effective, but it still isnt unbreakable.
