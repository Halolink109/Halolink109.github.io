title: Mobile Malware Analysis
---
Very similar to the last activity I underwent on TryHackMe this activity has you playing detective, but this time you launch a virtual machine to access malware files for mobile devices, specifically android. These files while harmless on windows, would be dangerous malware for android devices.

Here we use a website to look at the internal information for the .APK files that tell use more about what the files does, like various permissions including accessing your devices camera to take a peek whenever it pleases. The method of transporation for this virus is through bluetooth, meaning it could multiply and infect other devices that also use bluetooth. 

At the end of the activity there are other TryHackMe activities and websites dedicated to the security and code testing platforms for Android, very useful for whomever creates an android application of their own or decides to look into the security and integrity of the latest Angry Birds game on their phones.
