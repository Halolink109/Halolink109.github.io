title: Common Attacks at TryHackMe
---
This excersice was a great introduction on the most common types of attacks hackers employ when attempting to steal your information. Social engineering being a big one, malware and ransomware are also particularly commmon, having suffered a ransomware attack years ago as a child that has guidied me into being safer while browsing the web. The activity also mentions password managers, including one I already use myself; Keepass. The activity also touches on the importance of software updates as they can be good or bad for you depending on the situation. Most of the time it is important to stay up-to-date but also important to know what version of software you should be running because a newer one could also be vulnerable.
